                Dear Detective <span class="blurred">Karadec,</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                We have an urgent directive that requires your disciplined instincts and by-the-book precision. Intelligence reports indicate a critical breach connected to several major ongoing cases — including leads tied to <span class="blurred">Roman Sinquerra’s</span> disappearance and unusual activity from an unidentified adversary that’s been toying with the Major Crimes unit. Your tactical expertise will be essential in the next phase of operations.
            </p>

    
            <p>
                Lieutenant Soto has authorized you to pull resources from Major Crimes as needed, but she emphasizes the importance of no leaks. Every security breach, no matter how small, could jeopardize the entire operation — especially since HQ is watching after the recent high-profile viewership surge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here’s what you need to know (and keep closely guarded):
                <ul>
                    <li>We’ve intercepted signals that someone may be trying to manipulate evidence channels — unusually reminiscent of the <span class="blurred">“evidence board tampers”</span> from the Pilot investigation. This suggests a calculated disruption aimed at destabilizing Morgan’s intuition-driven insights. Only you can assess the gravity of this threat.</li>

                    <li>HQ has noticed a pattern similar to the unpredictability of a certain Game Maker-like antagonist (yes, the one that nearly compromised Morgan’s family’s safety late last season). Operational protocols insist you coordinate discreetly with Morgan — her lateral thinking and your structured methodology remain our most successful formula.</li>

                    <li>Reports show unusual traffic between LAPD channels and external surveillance at reconnect points near sites once tied to Roman’s last known activities. The lead might be close, but it’s complicated — and we trust no one else to parse the procedural evidence like you do.</li>
                </ul>
